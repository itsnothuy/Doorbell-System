# Codebase Quality Assurance Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how we maintain codebase quality through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), GitHub Issues, and Pull Requests in the Doorbell Security System project.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Purpose
ADRs document important architectural decisions to ensure:
- **Consistency**: All contributors understand why certain decisions were made
- **Quality**: Architectural choices are well-reasoned and documented
- **Maintainability**: Future changes can reference past decisions
- **Onboarding**: New contributors can understand the system architecture

### ADR Workflow Integration

#### 1. Before Major Changes
```bash
# Check existing ADRs
ls docs/adr/
cat docs/adr/ADR-*.md

# Create new ADR if needed
cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/ADR-XXX-new-decision.md
```

#### 2. In GitHub Issues
When creating architectural issues, reference relevant ADRs:
```markdown
## Context
This issue implements the face recognition system as outlined in [ADR-002](../docs/adr/ADR-002-face-recognition-implementation.md).

## Architectural Considerations
- Must align with modular monolith design (ADR-001)
- Should follow testing strategy from ADR-004
```

#### 3. In Pull Requests
PRs should reference ADRs for architectural compliance:
```markdown
## Architectural Compliance
- ✅ Follows modular monolith pattern (ADR-001)
- ✅ Implements face recognition as specified (ADR-002)
- ✅ Includes tests per strategy (ADR-004)
```

## GitHub Issues Quality Gates

### Issue Templates
Our issues should include:

1. **Architectural Context**
   - Reference relevant ADRs
   - Explain how the change fits the overall architecture

2. **Quality Requirements**
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation updates needed
   - Security considerations

3. **Definition of Done**
   - Code implementation
   - Tests written and passing
   - Documentation updated
   - ADR updated if architectural changes

### Example Issue Structure
```markdown
# Issue #XX: Implement Face Detection Worker Pool

## Context
Implements the face detection worker pool as outlined in [ADR-002](../docs/adr/ADR-002-face-recognition-implementation.md).

## Requirements
- Multi-process worker management
- Queue-based job distribution  
- Hardware-specific optimizations

## Architectural Considerations
- Must align with modular monolith design (ADR-001)
- Should integrate with testing strategy (ADR-004)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Worker pool implementation
- [ ] Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] ADR updated if design changes
```

### PR Review Checklist

#### Architectural Review
- [ ] **ADR Compliance**: Changes align with documented decisions
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Follows established patterns (modular monolith, etc.)
- [ ] **API Consistency**: New APIs follow existing conventions

#### Code Quality
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit and integration tests included
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code comments and documentation updated
- [ ] **Security**: Input validation and error handling
- [ ] **Performance**: No unnecessary performance degradation

#### Process Compliance
- [ ] **Issue Reference**: PR linked to GitHub issue
- [ ] **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit format
- [ ] **CI Passing**: All automated checks pass

### PR Template Integration
Our PR template should enforce ADR references:

```markdown
## Architectural Impact
- [ ] No architectural changes
- [ ] Minor change (fits existing ADRs)
- [ ] Major change (requires ADR update/creation)

### ADR References
List relevant ADRs and explain compliance:
- ADR-001 (System Architecture): [explanation]
- ADR-002 (Face Recognition): [explanation]

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
```bash
# Before starting work
git checkout -b feature/face-detection-worker

# Review relevant ADRs
cat docs/adr/ADR-002-face-recognition-implementation.md
cat docs/adr/ADR-004-testing-strategy.md
```

### 2. Implementation Phase
```bash
# Regular ADR checks during development
grep -r "face.detection" docs/adr/

# Update ADR if architectural changes needed
vi docs/adr/ADR-002-face-recognition-implementation.md
```

### 3. Review Phase
- Reviewers check ADR compliance
- Automated CI checks reference ADRs
- Documentation is updated

## Quality Metrics

### ADR Coverage
- All major architectural decisions documented
- ADRs referenced in related issues/PRs
- ADRs updated when decisions change

### Issue Quality
- Clear architectural context
- Proper ADR references
- Complete definition of done

### PR Quality
- Architectural impact assessed
- ADR compliance verified
- Quality gates passed

## Tools and Automation

### ADR Linting
```bash
# Check ADR format
./scripts/check-adr-format.sh docs/adr/

# Validate ADR references in issues/PRs
./scripts/validate-adr-references.sh
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/adr-check.yml
name: ADR Compliance Check
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  adr-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Check ADR References
        run: ./scripts/check-adr-compliance.sh
```

## Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Read ADRs first**: Before making architectural changes
2. **Reference ADRs**: In issues and PRs
3. **Update ADRs**: When decisions change
4. **Ask questions**: If ADRs are unclear

### For Maintainers
1. **Enforce ADR compliance**: In code reviews
2. **Keep ADRs current**: Update when architecture evolves
3. **Create new ADRs**: For new architectural decisions
4. **Review ADR quality**: Ensure they're clear and useful

### For Reviewers
1. **Check ADR alignment**: Verify changes follow documented decisions
2. **Suggest ADR updates**: When changes affect architecture
3. **Quality gate enforcement**: Ensure all quality criteria met
4. **Provide ADR feedback**: Help improve architectural documentation

## Conclusion

By integrating ADRs into our GitHub workflow, we ensure:
- **Consistent architecture** across all contributions
- **Quality code** that follows established patterns
- **Clear documentation** of architectural decisions
- **Smooth onboarding** for new contributors
- **Maintainable codebase** that scales over time

Remember: ADRs are living documents that should evolve with your architecture!
