# ADR-008: Production Deployment and Infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Related:** ADR-005 (Pipeline Architecture), ADR-006 (Communication Infrastructure)

## Context

The system needs production-ready deployment capabilities to support enterprise use cases and ensure reliable operation at scale:

1. **Deployment Requirements**: Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback
2. **Scalability Needs**: Auto-scaling to handle load variations and multiple deployment environments  
3. **Reliability Goals**: 99.9% uptime with comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. **Security Standards**: Enterprise-grade security with compliance and audit capabilities
5. **Operational Excellence**: Automated operations, disaster recovery, and maintenance
6. **Multi-Environment Support**: Development, staging, and production environments

Current deployment relies on basic Docker containers without orchestration, monitoring, or production hardening, making it unsuitable for enterprise deployment.

## Decision

We will implement a **Comprehensive Production Deployment Infrastructure** with multiple deployment strategies and enterprise-grade operational capabilities:

### Core Deployment Architecture

1. **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**
   - Zero-downtime deployments with traffic switching
   - Automated health checks and validation
   - Immediate rollback capability on failure
   - Environment isolation and testing
   - Database migration coordination

2. **Container Orchestration**
   - Kubernetes deployment for enterprise environments
   - Docker Compose for single-node deployments
   - Helm charts for complex deployments
   - Auto-scaling based on load metrics
   - Resource quotas and limits

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Terraform for cloud infrastructure provisioning
   - Ansible for configuration management
   - GitOps workflow for deployment automation
   - Environment parity across dev/staging/production
   - Immutable infrastructure principles

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards and visualization
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack
   - Intelligent alerting and incident response

### Deployment Pipeline Design

```
Code → Build → Test → Security Scan → Deploy to Staging → Validate → Deploy to Production → Monitor
  ↓      ↓       ↓         ↓              ↓               ↓            ↓                  ↓
 Git   Docker  CI/CD   Security      Blue-Green       Health        Traffic           Alerts
      Build    Tests    Tools         Deploy          Checks        Switch           Monitor
```

### Multi-Environment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local development with Docker Compose
   - Mock hardware for development
   - Fast iteration and debugging
   - Feature branch testing

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Production-like configuration
   - Full integration testing
   - Performance and load testing
   - Security and compliance validation

3. **Production Environment**
   - High availability configuration
   - Auto-scaling and load balancing
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Disaster recovery readiness

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional Server Deployment
**Rejected** because:
- Manual deployment processes prone to errors
- Difficult to achieve zero-downtime deployments
- Limited scalability and automation
- Complex environment management
- No immutable infrastructure benefits

### 2. Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda, etc.)
**Rejected** because:
- Cold start latency unacceptable for real-time processing
- Limited execution time for long-running processes
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Complex state management
- Cost implications for continuous processing

### 3. Platform as a Service (Heroku, Render)
**Considered but limited** because:
- Limited hardware access for edge device simulation
- Resource constraints for face recognition processing
- Limited customization for production requirements
- Vendor lock-in and cost scaling issues
- Insufficient control for security requirements

### 4. Virtual Machine-Based Deployment
**Rejected** because:
- Higher resource overhead than containers
- Slower deployment and scaling
- More complex configuration management
- Limited portability across environments
- Infrastructure drift and maintenance overhead

### 5. Docker Swarm
**Rejected** because:
- Limited ecosystem compared to Kubernetes
- Fewer enterprise features
- Less community support and tooling
- Limited multi-cloud support
- Simpler but less powerful than required
