# ADR-007: Detector Strategy Pattern and Hardware Abstraction

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Related:** ADR-005 (Pipeline Architecture), ADR-002 (Face Recognition Implementation)

## Context

The face detection component needs to support multiple hardware backends and optimization strategies to maximize performance across different deployment environments:

1. **Hardware Diversity**: CPU (x86, ARM), GPU (CUDA, OpenCL), EdgeTPU (Coral), Apple Silicon
2. **Performance Requirements**: Real-time face detection with varying computational resources
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: Support from Raspberry Pi to high-end servers
4. **Algorithm Options**: Different face detection models (HOG, CNN, SSD, MTCNN)
5. **Resource Constraints**: Memory and power limitations on edge devices
6. **Future Extensibility**: Easy addition of new detection backends and models

The current implementation uses a single face_recognition library approach that doesn't leverage hardware acceleration and limits performance optimization opportunities.

## Decision

We will implement a **Strategy Pattern for Face Detection** with comprehensive **Hardware Abstraction Layer**:

### Core Strategy Pattern Design

1. **Abstract Detector Interface (`BaseDetector`)**
   - Standardized API for all face detection implementations
   - Performance benchmarking and profiling integration
   - Configuration validation and optimization hints
   - Resource usage monitoring and reporting
   - Automatic fallback mechanism support

2. **Concrete Strategy Implementations**
   - `CPUDetector`: Optimized CPU-based detection using face_recognition/dlib
   - `GPUDetector`: GPU-accelerated detection using OpenCV DNN/TensorFlow
   - `EdgeTPUDetector`: Google Coral EdgeTPU optimized detection
   - `HybridDetector`: Multi-backend detection with automatic load balancing

3. **Detector Factory and Selection**
   - Automatic hardware capability detection
   - Performance-based detector selection
   - Runtime detector switching capability
   - Configuration-driven detector preferences
   - Fallback chain for unsupported hardware

4. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
   - Cross-platform hardware detection and capability enumeration
   - Resource monitoring and allocation management
   - Performance optimization suggestions
   - Hardware-specific configuration tuning
   - Mock implementations for testing and development

### Strategy Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_optimal_detector(hardware_config: HardwareConfig) -> BaseDetector:
    """Select best detector based on hardware capabilities and requirements."""
    
    # Priority order: EdgeTPU > GPU > CPU
    if hardware_config.has_edgetpu and requirements.allow_edgetpu:
        return EdgeTPUDetector(config.edgetpu)
    
    elif hardware_config.has_gpu and requirements.allow_gpu:
        return GPUDetector(config.gpu)
    
    else:
        return CPUDetector(config.cpu)
```

### Hardware Abstraction Design

1. **Platform Detection**
   - Operating system and architecture detection
   - Hardware capability enumeration (CPU cores, memory, GPU)
   - Accelerator detection (EdgeTPU, Neural Engine, etc.)
   - Performance characteristics measurement
   - Mock mode for development and testing

2. **Resource Management**
   - Memory allocation and monitoring
   - CPU/GPU utilization tracking
   - Temperature and power monitoring (where available)
   - Resource contention detection and resolution
   - Automatic resource optimization

3. **Configuration Adaptation**
   - Hardware-specific parameter tuning
   - Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs
   - Resource constraint adaptation
   - Automatic fallback configuration
   - Runtime optimization suggestions

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Detection Library (Current)
**Rejected** because:
- Limited to CPU processing only
- No hardware acceleration utilization
- Fixed algorithm choice
- Poor performance scaling
- No optimization for different hardware

### 2. Direct Hardware-Specific Libraries
**Rejected** because:
- Tight coupling to specific hardware
- Complex conditional compilation
- Difficult testing and development
- No graceful degradation
- High maintenance overhead

### 3. Plugin Architecture with Dynamic Loading
**Rejected** because:
- Complex dependency management
- Runtime loading failures
- Security concerns with dynamic code
- Difficult packaging and deployment
- Debugging complexity

### 4. Microservice per Detector Type
**Rejected** because:
- Network overhead unacceptable for real-time processing
- Complex service discovery and management
- Resource overhead on edge devices
- Deployment complexity
- Not suitable for edge computing

### 5. Direct OpenCV DNN Module
**Considered but insufficient** because:
- Limited model format support
- No automatic hardware optimization
- Missing benchmarking and fallback
- Limited to OpenCV ecosystem
- No performance monitoring
