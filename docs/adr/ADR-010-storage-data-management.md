**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Related:** ADR-009 (Security Architecture), ADR-005 (Pipeline Architecture)

## Context

The system requires comprehensive data management capabilities to handle biometric data, events, configuration, and operational data across different environments:

1. **Data Types and Requirements**:
   - **Biometric Data**: Face encodings requiring encryption and special protection
   - **Event Data**: High-volume time-series data for monitoring and analytics
   - **Configuration Data**: System settings, user preferences, and operational parameters
   - **Media Data**: Captured images and video clips with retention policies
   - **Audit Data**: Immutable audit trails for compliance and security

2. **Performance Requirements**:
   - **Low Latency**: Sub-50ms access for face recognition queries
   - **High Throughput**: Support for 1000+ events/second ingestion
   - **Concurrent Access**: Multiple pipeline workers accessing data simultaneously
   - **Real-time Analytics**: Live dashboards and monitoring capabilities

3. **Operational Requirements**:
   - **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies with automatic cleanup
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup with point-in-time recovery
   - **Migration Support**: Schema evolution and data migration capabilities
   - **Multi-Environment**: Consistent data management across dev/staging/production

Current implementation uses basic file storage and simple SQLite databases, which cannot meet enterprise performance, reliability, and compliance requirements.

## Decision

We will implement a **Multi-Tier Data Management Architecture** with specialized storage solutions optimized for different data types and access patterns:

### Core Storage Architecture

1. **Biometric Data Store**
   - **Primary**: Encrypted PostgreSQL with specialized face encoding extensions
   - **Caching**: Redis for high-performance face matching operations
   - **Backup**: Encrypted backup with key rotation and secure storage
   - **Indexing**: Vector similarity indexing for fast face matching
   - **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant with secure deletion capabilities

2. **Event Data Store**
   - **Primary**: InfluxDB for time-series event data and metrics
   - **Streaming**: Apache Kafka for real-time event processing (optional)
   - **Analytics**: ClickHouse for complex analytics and reporting
   - **Archival**: Object storage (S3/MinIO) for long-term retention
   - **Real-time**: In-memory caching for live dashboards

3. **Configuration Management**
   - **Primary**: Consul or etcd for distributed configuration
   - **Versioning**: Git-based configuration with approval workflows
   - **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault for secure credential management
   - **Environment**: Environment-specific configuration overlays
   - **Hot-reload**: Dynamic configuration updates without restart

4. **Media and File Storage**
   - **Primary**: Object storage (S3/MinIO) with CDN distribution
   - **Processing**: Temporary storage for image processing pipeline
   - **Thumbnails**: Generated thumbnails with multiple size variants
   - **Retention**: Lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup
   - **Compression**: Optimized compression for storage efficiency

### Data Management Patterns

1. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separate read and write data models for optimization
   - Event sourcing for audit trails and data lineage
   - Materialized views for complex queries
   - Read replicas for scaling query workloads

2. **Event Sourcing**
   - Immutable event streams for complete audit trails
   - Event replay for system recovery and debugging
   - Snapshot creation for performance optimization
   - Schema evolution and migration support

3. **Data Partitioning and Sharding**
   - Time-based partitioning for event data
   - Geographic partitioning for multi-region deployments
   - Consistent hashing for biometric data distribution
   - Automatic rebalancing and scaling

### Migration and Evolution Strategy

1. **Schema Migration Framework**
   - Automated database schema evolution
   - Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime migrations
   - Rollback capabilities for failed migrations
   - Data validation and integrity checking

2. **Data Pipeline Architecture**
   - ETL pipelines for data transformation and loading
   - Change data capture (CDC) for real-time synchronization
   - Data quality monitoring and validation
   - Lineage tracking for compliance and debugging

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Database Solution (PostgreSQL)
**Rejected** because:
- Poor performance for time-series event data
- Suboptimal for vector similarity search
- Scaling limitations for high-volume workloads
- Not optimized for different data access patterns
- Complex to optimize for all use cases

### 2. NoSQL Document Database (MongoDB)
**Rejected** because:
- Lack of ACID transactions for critical biometric data
- Complex queries for relational data patterns
- Vector similarity search limitations
- Compliance and audit trail challenges
- Operational complexity for multi-model requirements

### 3. Pure Cloud Database Services
**Considered but limited** because:
- Vendor lock-in and portability concerns
- Cost scaling issues for high-volume data
- Limited control over performance optimization
- Edge deployment challenges
- Compliance and data sovereignty requirements

### 4. File-Based Storage (Current)
**Inadequate** because:
- No ACID transactions or consistency guarantees
- Poor performance for complex queries
- Limited concurrent access capabilities
- No built-in backup and recovery
- Compliance and audit trail limitations

### 5. In-Memory Databases (Redis Only)
**Rejected** because:
- Data persistence and durability concerns
- Memory cost for large datasets
- Limited query capabilities
- No built-in backup and recovery
- Single point of failure risks
