# ADR-009: Security Architecture and Compliance

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Related:** ADR-008 (Production Deployment), ADR-005 (Pipeline Architecture)

## Context

The doorbell security system processes sensitive biometric data (face encodings), personal information, and security events, requiring comprehensive security measures:

1. **Data Protection Requirements**: Face encodings are considered biometric PII requiring special protection
2. **Privacy Regulations**: GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws mandate data protection controls
3. **Security Threats**: Remote access vulnerabilities, data breaches, unauthorized access
4. **Audit and Compliance**: Need for comprehensive audit trails and compliance reporting
5. **Network Security**: Secure communication and access controls for remote monitoring
6. **Edge Device Security**: Physical security and tamper detection for deployed devices

Current implementation has basic security measures but lacks comprehensive security architecture, encryption, audit trails, and compliance capabilities required for enterprise deployment.

## Decision

We will implement a **Comprehensive Security Architecture** with defense-in-depth principles and compliance capabilities:

### Core Security Architecture

1. **Data Protection and Encryption**
   - Encryption at rest for all biometric data using AES-256
   - Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3 for all communications
   - Key management with Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
   - Face encoding anonymization and pseudonymization
   - Secure data deletion and retention policies

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
   - API key management with rotation and expiration
   - Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for enterprise environments
   - Device authentication and certificate management

3. **Network Security**
   - Network segmentation and micro-segmentation
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting
   - VPN access for remote administration
   - Intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS)

4. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Comprehensive audit logging with immutable storage
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance controls and data subject rights
   - Security incident detection and response
   - Compliance reporting and dashboards
   - Data lineage and retention management

### Security Controls Framework

1. **Preventive Controls**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Security headers and CSRF protection
   - Access controls and authentication
   - Network security and firewall rules
   - Secure coding practices and code review

2. **Detective Controls**
   - Security monitoring and SIEM integration
   - Anomaly detection and behavioral analysis
   - Vulnerability scanning and assessment
   - Log analysis and correlation
   - Threat intelligence integration

3. **Corrective Controls**
   - Incident response procedures
   - Automated threat remediation
   - Security patch management
   - Data breach response protocols
   - Recovery and continuity procedures

### Privacy by Design Implementation

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Collect only necessary biometric data
   - Automatic data retention and deletion
   - Purpose limitation and consent management
   - Data anonymization where possible
   - Privacy-preserving analytics

2. **Transparency and Control**
   - Clear privacy notices and consent mechanisms
   - Data subject access and portability rights
   - Deletion and rectification capabilities
   - Privacy preference management
   - Consent withdrawal mechanisms

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Basic Security Implementation
**Rejected** because:
- Insufficient for enterprise and regulated environments
- No compliance framework support
- Limited audit and monitoring capabilities
- Vulnerable to advanced security threats
- Cannot meet data protection requirements

### 2. Third-Party Security Service Integration
**Considered but limited** because:
- Vendor dependency and lock-in concerns
- Cost implications for comprehensive coverage
- Limited customization for specific requirements
- Potential performance impact for real-time processing
- Data sovereignty and control concerns

### 3. Cloud Provider Native Security
**Partially adopted** because:
- Good foundation but insufficient alone
- Vendor lock-in and portability concerns
- Limited control over implementation details
- Cost scaling issues
- Need for hybrid and on-premises support

### 4. Open Source Security Tools Only
**Considered but insufficient** because:
- Integration complexity and maintenance overhead
- Limited enterprise support and SLA
- Security expertise requirements
- Compliance certification challenges
- Operational complexity
