   - Added `_verify_hmac()` for optional HMAC authentication
   - Replaced 6 placeholder checksums with production SHA-256 hashes
   - Removed security bypass logic (lines 205-206)

2. **tests/test_model_manager.py** (new file)
   - 30+ comprehensive test cases
   - Security-focused tests for tampered file detection
   - Hash calculation accuracy verification
   - Size validation testing
   - Download security testing

3. **scripts/generate_model_hashes.py** (new utility)
   - Automated hash generation for model files
   - Configurable version and base URL
   - Secure whitelist-based algorithm selection
   - Production-ready code generation

4. **docs/model_manager_security.md** (new documentation)

   - Troubleshooting guide

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Cryptographic Hash Verification
- **SHA-256 hashes** for all 6 models in registry
- **Multi-algorithm support** (SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5)
- **Chunk-based calculation** for large files
- **Validation at initialization** via ModelInfo dataclass

### 2. Model Integrity Verification
- **5-layer verification process**:
  1. Model name validation
  2. File existence check
  3. File size validation
  4. SHA-256 hash verification
  5. Optional HMAC verification

### 3. Secure Download
- **SSL/TLS encryption** with certificate verification
- **Size limits** (200MB default) to prevent DoS
- **Chunked downloads** with progress tracking
- **Atomic file operations** (temp file → rename)
- **Automatic cleanup** on failure

### 4. HMAC Verification (Optional)
- **HMAC-SHA256** for additional authentication
- **Constant-time comparison** to prevent timing attacks
- **Flexible deployment** (optional feature)

## Security Threats Mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Model Tampering | SHA-256 hash verification detects any changes |
| Supply Chain Attacks | SSL/TLS + hash verification |
| MITM Attacks | Certificate verification during download |
| Size-Based DoS | File size validation and limits |
| Insider Threats | Runtime integrity verification |
